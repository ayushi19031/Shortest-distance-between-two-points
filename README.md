# Shortest-distance-between-two-points
Divide and Conquer algorithm in python

# PURPOSE
Use of brute force to find minimum distance between two points in a 2-D space. Further, implementation of divide and conquer algorithm to find the same. 
# PRINCIPLES USED  
1. Involves use of the fact that if any two points in a box are at a distance of d apart,then, only 6 points an exist in that box.
2. MergeSort uses only nlogn time to find the shortest distance between two points
3. Extensve use of functional programming
